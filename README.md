## My process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Shadcn UI
- React Icons


### What I learned

I made use of useRef for the first time, useRef basically stores a dom element so that it would not chand on a rerender, so i used it to send the information from the user to email.js.


### Continued development

I need to work on use UseRef() more often
